// SlimArray compresses a uint32 array with overall trend by describing the trend
// with a polynomial, e.g., to store a sorted array is very common in practice.
// Such as an block-list of IP addresses, or a series of var-length record
// position on disk.
//
// E.g. a uint32 costs only 5 bits in average in a sorted array of a million
// number in range [0, 1000*1000].
//
// In addition to the unbelievable low memory footprint,
// a `Get` access is also very fast: it takes only 10 nano second in our
// benchmark.

// SlimArray is also ready for transport since it is defined with protobuf. E.g.:
//    a := slimarray.NewU32([]uint32{1, 2, 3})
//    bytes, err := proto.Marshal(a)
//
// Since 0.1.1
